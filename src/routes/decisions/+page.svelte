<h3>Choices, choices...</h3>
<p>
    Starting with the group that recieved the least votes (but at least two),
    everyone simultaneously chooses whether to commit to working in that group, or
    waiting to participate in a more popular group.
</p>
<p>
    If enough people
    commit to the group, it runs â€” otherwise, they can join another group.
